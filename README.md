## Notes

- when writing HTML inside of React, `className="smthng"` is used as opposed to the usual `class="smthng"`, because class is already reserved for JS Class
- JSX (JavaScript eXtensible Markup Language) is often used in place of JS files, these files make HTML insertion more readable & efficient
- _Props = Properties._ A function or class should never modify the props `<i need to add a code example!!>`

# Everything starts with a ROOT

<img src="https://www.vibconferences.be/sites/default/files/styles/event_slider_detail/public/2021-12/bean%20root_GPhase_larger.jpg?itok=rM6rEswE" alt="root" width="200">

`<div id="root"></div>`
this is a 'root' in HTML that we've already created

`const root = ReactDOM.createRoot( document.getElementById('root') );`
this is how you'd create a root in JS

`const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>; root.render(element);`
this is how you would render the H1 element _inside_ of the DOM root
